This is a Kotlin Multiplatform project targeting Android, iOS, Web, Desktop (JVM).

## ðŸŽ¨ UI Architecture - Atomic Design

This project implements the **Atomic Design** methodology for UI components, providing a scalable and maintainable component hierarchy with a warm color theme.

### Component Structure

- **Atoms** (5 components): Basic UI elements (Button, Text, Icon, Spacer, Card)
- **Molecules** (4 components): Simple combinations of atoms
- **Organisms** (5 components): Complex sections combining molecules
- **Templates** (2 templates): Page layout structures
- **Pages** (2+ pages): Complete pages with data and state management

### Theme

The app uses a **warm color palette** designed for a calm, comfortable user experience:
- Primary: Warm terracotta (#D4856A)
- Secondary: Soft peach (#E8B4A0)
- Tertiary: Warm beige (#E5D4C1)
- Background: Warm white (#FAF4F0)

## Project Structure

* [/composeApp](./composeApp/src) is for code that will be shared across your Compose Multiplatform applications.
  It contains several subfolders:
  - [commonMain](./composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin) is for code thatâ€™s common for all targets.
  - Other folders are for Kotlin code that will be compiled for only the platform indicated in the folder name.
    For example, if you want to use Appleâ€™s CoreCrypto for the iOS part of your Kotlin app,
    the [iosMain](./composeApp/src/iosMain/kotlin) folder would be the right place for such calls.
    Similarly, if you want to edit the Desktop (JVM) specific part, the [jvmMain](./composeApp/src/jvmMain/kotlin)
    folder is the appropriate location.

* [/iosApp](./iosApp/iosApp) contains iOS applications. Even if youâ€™re sharing your UI with Compose Multiplatform,
  you need this entry point for your iOS app. This is also where you should add SwiftUI code for your project.

### Build and Run Android Application

To build and run the development version of the Android app, use the run configuration from the run widget
in your IDEâ€™s toolbar or build it directly from the terminal:
- on macOS/Linux
  ```shell
  ./gradlew :composeApp:assembleDebug
  ```
- on Windows
  ```shell
  .\gradlew.bat :composeApp:assembleDebug
  ```

### Build and Run Desktop (JVM) Application

To build and run the development version of the desktop app, use the run configuration from the run widget
in your IDEâ€™s toolbar or run it directly from the terminal:
- on macOS/Linux
  ```shell
  ./gradlew :composeApp:run
  ```
- on Windows
  ```shell
  .\gradlew.bat :composeApp:run
  ```

### Build and Run Web Application

To build and run the development version of the web app, use the run configuration from the run widget
in your IDE's toolbar or run it directly from the terminal:
- for the Wasm target (faster, modern browsers):
  - on macOS/Linux
    ```shell
    ./gradlew :composeApp:wasmJsBrowserDevelopmentRun
    ```
  - on Windows
    ```shell
    .\gradlew.bat :composeApp:wasmJsBrowserDevelopmentRun
    ```
- for the JS target (slower, supports older browsers):
  - on macOS/Linux
    ```shell
    ./gradlew :composeApp:jsBrowserDevelopmentRun
    ```
  - on Windows
    ```shell
    .\gradlew.bat :composeApp:jsBrowserDevelopmentRun
    ```

### Build and Run iOS Application

To build and run the development version of the iOS app, use the run configuration from the run widget
in your IDEâ€™s toolbar or open the [/iosApp](./iosApp) directory in Xcode and run it from there.
