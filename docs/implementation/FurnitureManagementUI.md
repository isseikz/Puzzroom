# Furniture Management UI Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds a furniture management system to the Puzzroom application, allowing users to create and manage furniture templates independently from specific projects.

## Navigation Flow

```
ProjectList (Start)
    |
    +-- [Navigate to Projects] --> ProjectList
    |
    +-- [Navigate to Furniture Library] --> FurnitureManagement
    |       |
    |       +-- [Click + button] --> FurnitureCreation
    |               |
    |               +-- [Preset Mode] - Select from FurnitureTemplate.PRESETS
    |               +-- [Simple Editor] - Create rectangular furniture (width x depth)
    |               +-- [Detailed Editor] - Create custom polygon shapes
    |               |
    |               +-- [Create/Cancel] --> Back to FurnitureManagement
    |
    +-- [Navigate to Room] --> RoomScreen
    |
    +-- [Navigate to Furniture] --> FurnitureScreen
            |
            +-- Furniture placement (no custom creation button)
```

## Key Components

### 1. FurnitureManagementPage
**Location:** `ui/pages/FurnitureManagementPage.kt`

**Purpose:** Main screen for viewing all furniture templates in the library

**Features:**
- Lists all furniture templates from AppState
- Shows empty state when no templates exist
- Provides "+" button to navigate to creation screen
- Uses ListScreenTemplate for consistent UI

### 2. FurnitureCreationPage
**Location:** `ui/pages/FurnitureCreationPage.kt`

**Purpose:** Screen for creating new furniture templates with three different modes

**Creation Modes:**

#### a) Preset Mode
- Displays all items from `FurnitureTemplate.PRESETS`
- User selects a preset and adds it to their library
- Uses FurnitureTemplateCard for display

#### b) Simple Editor
- Input fields:
  - Name (text field)
  - Category (filter chips for all FurnitureCategory options)
  - Width (numeric input in cm)
  - Depth (numeric input in cm)
- Creates rectangular furniture template

#### c) Detailed Editor
- Input fields:
  - Name (text field)
  - Category (filter chips)
- Uses EditablePolygonCanvas for drawing custom shapes
- Click to add vertices
- Click on first vertex to close the polygon
- Calculates bounding box for width/depth

### 3. Updated Navigation
**Location:** `AppNavigation.kt`

**Changes:**
- Added AppScreen.FurnitureManagement enum
- Added AppScreen.FurnitureCreation enum
- Added navigation buttons for "Projects" and "Furniture Library"
- Navigation bar shows on all screens except ProjectList

### 4. Updated FurnitureScreen
**Location:** `ui/screen/FurnitureScreen.kt`

**Changes:**
- Removed "Create custom furniture" button
- Now focuses only on furniture selection and placement
- Users must use FurnitureManagement screen to create furniture

## Data Flow

```
AppState
    |
    +-- furnitureTemplates: List<FurnitureTemplate>
            |
            +-- Initial: FurnitureTemplate.PRESETS
            |
            +-- addCustomFurnitureTemplate(template)
                    |
                    +-- Called from FurnitureCreationPage
                    +-- Adds new template to list (session-only)
```

## Architecture Pattern

The implementation follows the Atomic Design pattern used in the project:

- **Pages:** FurnitureManagementPage, FurnitureCreationPage (top-level screens)
- **Organisms:** FurnitureLibraryPanel, FurnitureTemplateCard (reusable complex components)
- **Templates:** ListScreenTemplate (layout structure)
- **Atoms:** AppButton, AppText, AppCard (basic UI elements)

## Requirements Fulfillment

✅ **Requirement 1:** Add furniture management UI to app's first screen
   - Added "Furniture Library" navigation button accessible from all screens

✅ **Requirement 2:** Place a "Create New" button in furniture management UI
   - FurnitureManagementPage includes "+" button in top bar

✅ **Requirement 3:** Create furniture registration screen with three editors
   - FurnitureCreationPage provides:
     - Preset List from FurnitureTemplate.PRESETS
     - Simple Editor for rectangular furniture
     - Detailed Editor with EditablePolygonCanvas

✅ **Requirement 4:** Remove custom creation button from FurnitureScreen
   - Removed onCreateCustom parameter from FurnitureLibraryPanel
   - FurnitureScreen now focuses on selection and placement only

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements not included in this minimal implementation:

1. **Persistence:** Currently furniture templates are session-only. Could add database storage.
2. **Edit/Delete:** Add ability to edit or delete custom furniture templates.
3. **Preview:** Show visual preview of furniture shape in creation screen.
4. **Import/Export:** Allow sharing furniture templates between users.
5. **Custom Polygon Storage:** Detailed editor creates templates but doesn't store the custom polygon shape yet (only bounding box).
